# Hello! This is the frontend of the “To-Do App” app made in react native

It is very necessary for the correct functioning of the application. It may be optional to keep this repository and the frontend one in the same folder for better control.

# Important, to install the project you need nodejs

Installation is done with the command ``npm install``

To start the server you can do it with ``npm start`` or ``npx expo start`` which will activate the server.

###### To delete the cache that could cause an error in metro builder you can do it with ``npx expo start -c`` or other commands

Comments in the code can be important depending on the case or errors that may occur during the execution of the project, however they can be eliminated.

###### In the ``fetch`` ``192.168.0.13`` you must modify it as required. If you are using android studio locally you can use the following: ``localhost`` or ``127.0.0.1``, if you want to use ``expo go`` it might be advisable to use your IP address (You can see this information with the ``ipconfig`` command in ``command prompt (CMD)``), always taking into account the ``:8080`` since it is the backend port on which the server is enabled

###### One point that may be important is the credentials, they can be used for the process, the api credential could be used ``{"x-api-key": "abcdef123456"}`` in the header, also it is necessary to specify the ``application/json``

###### It is important to verify the compatibility of the libraries used, it is also important to verify their updates since they may include some vulnerability

I hope these points are useful for your development :)
